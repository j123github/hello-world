## Documentation

Canonical Markdown documentation at https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

## Examples

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)



# This is an `<h1>` tag 
## This is an `<h2>` tag
###### This is an `<h6>` tag

Note that backticks are used to escape the HTML tags.


Quotes are achieved via `> ` at the start of a line:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
